## Description
This mod change the format of the date message used in both the timeline and the event window. It allows to display the year in addition to the week and day of the default in game format.
The default year is 3025 as per the era the game campaign is set in, but it can be changed to any year in the mod settings.
The number of weeks per year can be configured as well but this has an effect on the number of days per year since the mod calculates the length of a year by multiplying the number of weeks by 7.
With the terran format, the date use a standard format displaying the month and the day of the month.

The number of weeks per year is not used if you choose this format.
